My name is Samy Palaniappan and I am a curious engineer. In this blog, I describe my exploration into the world of data science. The purpose of this blog is to illustrate my learning experiences as I wander into this vast jungle of data with untapped knowledge. In this process, I hope to create a repository of information, that will help navigate any new and brave venturers aspiring to enter this field after spending a long time in any other field, such as myself. And so we go...
